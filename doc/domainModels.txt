huge goals break down to big tasks
big tasks break down into smaller todos
[no reason to have three levels; could be N levels and give them alpha, bravo, 
 charlie -level task names]
 
daily mastery tasks become recurring, scheduled todos

calendar events are basically scheduled todos
calendar events could hook to bigger life-goals, like 'stay tuned in to local
 music scene'
 
random what-to-do-right-now events (go climb camelback or eat some Cornish
 Pasty) are also simple, repeatable todos; events
 
So...

Event is the core of the system.
  Event is a todo task, something on the calendar, your daily practice, a one-
    off thing picked at random for when you're bored.
    
EventTree is a cascading parent/child tree of events

Calendar is a list of scheduled events.







My elevator pitch for 'whats going on' app from 2015...
 "What's going on is an app that tells you exactly that.  Events, activities, 
 venues are entered into the app's database by a community of users.  When you 
 want to know what's going on, the app can show you a map of nearby fun, or it 
 can show you a calendar of events based on the current time and date.  Events, 
 activities and venues include metadata, so that as the app grows larger than 
 your particular tribe, your what's going on report will not be clouded with a 
 bunch of junk you don't care about.  Of course, you can see everything, but 
 things closest to your heart will display with priority."
